  Q. We are in the business of manufacturing wooden furniture. During course of our business we supplied furniture of Rs 1 million, but our client dishonoured the cheque. We lodged First Information Report (FIR) under section 489-F Pakistan Penal Code after that he paid us half the amount and then he ran away. We do not have any idea about his whereabouts. Court has issued proclaimed offender notice, he is untraceable. Now as he is untraceable and vanished still what can we do?
  </h4>
    <p>A. After getting him declared as proclaimed offender you should ask the court to proceed in the matter and get all your evidence recorded, this will help you when he will be arrested and if at that time for some reason or the other witnesses are not available court can proceed with the matter on the basis of the evidence earlier recorded in his absence. Simultaneously, on his last known address you can also file suit for recovery in the civil court.
