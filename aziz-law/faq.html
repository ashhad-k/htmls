      <div>
        <h4>Q: What are the ways marriage can be dissolved in Pakistan? </h4>
        <p>A: Marriage can be dissolved in any of the given ways i.e. divorce by the husband at his will without the intervention of a court commonly called a “Talaq”; by mutual consent of the husband and wife, without intervention of the court; by a judicial decree at the instance of the court and by the wife in exercise of a contractual right of divorce. </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li> <span class="number">03</span>
      <div>
        <h4>Q. What is meant by “Khula”?</h4>
        <p>A: Khula is the right of a wife in Islam to seek dissolution of marriage from her husband through intervention of the court. A woman seeks a “khula” while man gives a “Talaq”. </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li> <span class="number">04</span>
      <div>
        <h4>Q. What grounds are available to a wife to get Divorce according to Laws of Pakistan? </h4>
        <p>A: As per Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act a woman shall be entitled to obtain a decree for the dissolution of her marriage on any one or more of the following grounds:
          Whereabouts of the husband not known for four years; Husband has neglected or failed to provide maintenance; Husband has sentenced to imprisonment for a period of seven years or upwards; Husband failed to perform marital obligations for a period of three years; Husband was impotent at the time of marriage; Husband has been insane for two years; She was married when she was minor; Husband treats with cruelty; Leads an infamous life; Attempts to force her immoral life; Venereal disease; Incurable form of leprosy; Disposes of her property; Obstructs her in observance of her religious practice; If she cannot live with the husband within the limitation imposed by the Almighty Allah.

        <p>A: If wife is not delegated the right of divorce in her nikanama (marriage contract form) then she would apply for khula in the court. When the wife files a suit for dissolution of marriage the court issues notice to the opposite party i.e. the husband and if he fails to appear after the due process of posting and publication the court can proceed with the case ex-parte and pass a decree. In case where the husband or his representative appear he is required to file a written statement following which the court has to fix a date for pre-trial proceedings for reconciliation. If reconciliation fails court will pass decree for dissolution of marriage. </p>
